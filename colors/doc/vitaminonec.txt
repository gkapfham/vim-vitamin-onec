		Vitamin-Onec-Timesthree color scheme    by Lifepillar

Vitamin-Onec-Timesthree is a colorful dark colorscheme inspired by the colors of Apple's WWDC16
event. Apart from the fact that I shamelessly copied some color codes from the
CSS of their web page (and changed some of them), this color scheme has
nothing to do with Apple, so it may be safely used by Linux users as well
(FreeBSD users won't have any problems, I guess).
